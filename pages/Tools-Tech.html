        For our Home Aquaponics Monitoring System (H.A.M.S) there will be two forms of hardware that are required outside the basic laptop/desktop computer which most people have access too. One will be a Raspberry Pi device and the other temperature sensors, which are very cheap and obtainable through many online stores. These two will be the basis for allowing us to create, with further software implementations, a basic set up for monitoring environment variables.  
        <br />
        <br />
        Alongside the hardware components we will require software and tools such as listed below.  
        <ul>
          <li>Raspbian OS</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>RRDTool</li>
          <li>Git</li>
          <li>Chart.js Library</li>
          <li>Linux Distribution - Debian</li>
          <li>SSH Protocol</li>
          <li>Nginx</li>
          <li>Git</li>
        </ul>
        Our github audit trail somewhat represents the amount of work conributed by each team member, though majority of our team work was done using other collaborative tools such as Microsoft Teams.  We have attempted to
         collaborate, each commiting our own changces, though some team members worked more on other parts of the project such a the concept pitch video, which is note represented in github.
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        All of these tools/resources/software's are open source and readily available to anyone making them ideal for us to use in our product/project without the need for purchasing anything. 
        <br />
        <br />
        There will be no software licenses needed at present in order to get our H.A.M.S into the initial set up.  
        <br />
        <br />
        Our group as a whole have had some prior experience in the tools and software listed such as Python, but many of us have not had to deal with software and tools such as RRDTool or Nagios. Through the setup of H.A.M.S, Sam has created, implemented and got the hardware and software set up through the use of a Raspberry Pi device. From this, team members have been able to learn along the way and research topics that we were newly introduced too, expanding our knowledge of devices, software and hardware in relation to our project.
