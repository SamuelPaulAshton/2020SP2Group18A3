            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="../../img/block/block.jpg" width=300px style="float: left; margin-right: 2%">
                Blockchain technology is a decentralized and distributed, digital ledger used to record transactions of any type whereas cryptocurrencies are a digital currency that operates independently of a central bank, cryptocurrencies commonly use blockchain technology to operate, maintain and distribute themselves. Blockchain has the option to use a public ledger which is why it is referred to as public. What makes blockchain technology state of the art is its decentralisation due to its distributed digital ledger, this means that instead of one database keeping a record of all its data or transactions that record is made public to everyone with the public key, this allows an indefinite number of copies of the records making it almost impossible to hack. Even if someone was to create a public record, the system would recognise its difference to all other existing records, and it would be changed to be the same as all others. The private key (which is an extension of the public key) is what allows users of a cryptocurrency or blockchain software product to interact with each other, ie in the case of bitcoin transfer bitcoin from one user to another user.   
                <br>
                <br>
                With the first cryptocurrency and the first use of blockchain technology being only in 2009 (bitcoin), these technologies are fairly new, and their potential has really yet to be explored. Currently, many large corporations are starting to use or are exploring blockchain technologies and the potential increase to productivity or efficiencies in their business, some of these include Shell, ANZ, DHL, and Bank of China. All of the corporations are looking at or are implementing blockchain in their transaction or record keeping.          
                <br>
                <br>
                In the next three years, it could be expected that many larger corporations that have the capital and willingness to invest in the technology will involve it in any part of their business. This could be a part of many different types of businesses and involve helping shorten their supply chain, medical record-keeping, transactional logs, stock movement, with its implementation use up to the creativity of the designer.    
                <br>
                <br>
                In terms of banking, blockchain will allow for much faster and secure transactions, due to its decentralisation it would allow people to send or receive money and be approved quicker due to the algorithms running 24/7 and with no need for two or more banking institutions to approve a transaction. Currently, transactions can happen in a fraction of second but the actual process of verifying that either account exists and has access or is allowed to transfer the amounts being sent can take up to several business days and requires banks to have different arrangements and agreements all over the world. By removing this complicated verifying process blockchain has the ability to revolutionise not just the banking sector but many different finance sectors including stockbroking and land transfers which both have a very similar issue when it comes to verifying transfers.

                Cryptocurrencies, already a highly tradeable currency, have yet to make a big dent in traditional spending. In the next three years we could see a greater shift towards people not just trading cryptocurrency but using them as you would a traditional currency to purchase goods and services.    
                <br>
                <br>
                Ever increasing internet speeds and interconnectivity of the world is what fuels blockchain’s true ability and what makes any cryptocurrencies universal and a truly world wide currency. In the cryptocurrency world (especially shown with bitcoin) the ability to be a part of the system also known as “mining” makes the systems viable by allowing users to be a part of the verification process in reward for a small amount of the currency itself, this ability to “mine” is what allows the cryptocurrency world to function and be so private and secure. </p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
            <p>This technology could have important impacts on the operation of our financial services and additional follow on effects to our security and privacy. It may change the way our transactions are stored and accessed, also the speed that certain transactions are authorised and approved at(take “at” out. In the future businesses that integrate this technology into their business model, will create improved efficiencies in the way certain data or certain processes are done internally. For example, stock changes or tracking supply chains across multiple subsidiaries or global companies. With some large corporations or certain industries, it will help the way data or records are shared, increasing their interoperability, ie. Government contractors that need to share a transaction that requires authorisation and approval will be able to have the technology run 24/7 and externally to either organisation.  
                <br>
                <br>
                An important impact of this technology that we are starting to see as cryptocurrencies, become more known to us in their use in criminal activities and how authorities are adapting to this. Due to our current banking systems being centralised and compliant to a different country’s laws and other international laws, transactions can easily be traced but with the decentralisation that blockchain and cryptocurrencies have, it allows them to transfer any cryptocurrencies and have their identity and details of their transaction kept private. This negative effect will need to be overcome to see cryptocurrency become an important part in our economy.     
                <br>
                <br>
                This technology could potentially affect people whose jobs revolve around record-keeping, whether that is physical or digital records. It may see some of them lose their jobs, but this will possibly be countered by the increase in jobs to build and maintain the blockchain system. Over the next few decades, blockchain technology could replace the current technologies and systems that currently support our information storage across the world wide web and centralised servers, whether for private or public business. This process is slow because it does not provide an upfront cost-benefit but a long term efficiency benefit if the company/institution can implement it correctly.  
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
            <p>In your daily life, this technology can change how your personal information and day to day transactions happen. You as an individual may not see the changes yourself but your privacy and security will be looked at in another way. You may have a greater sense of privacy and security when using online transactions with your private data, especially in the areas of finance and medical data, which may see the biggest use of blockchain. These changes will see the basic background of all our interactions and storing of our data effected, you may no longer worry about the privacy concerns for such things as My health records in Australia if it were to use blockchain technology or loss of credit card information if platforms on the web are using blockchain or any type of cryptocurrency to make payments for goods and services.   
                <br>

                <img src="../../img/block/phone.jpeg" width=200px style="float: right; margin-left: 2%">
                Even with the increasing use and potential changes into cryptocurrency, the way we make purchases and complete transactions won’t likely change, we will most likely continue to use the currency we currently have, transitioning from a central bank system where all our transactions are processed to a blockchain system where we are still issued cryptocurrency and will more than likely have today's larger banks act in a similar fashion to what they do today as holders and lenders of the cryptocurrency. This may affect your friends and family if you are separated overseas as blockchain technology and cryptocurrency is very easy and quick to send over borders due to the decentralised nature of both technologies.   </p>
