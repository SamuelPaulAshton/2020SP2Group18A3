            <p><b>What Went Well:</b><br>
                Overall, our group worked very well together.  I believe that everyone contributed to the best of their ability.  Some members may have felt that they had not contributed enough but brought this up in meetings themselves in order to be able to contribute more.  Decisions on how we were going to proceed we made as a group and meeting minutes were taken to ensure that outcomes were met.  We did not necessarily give each other deadlines until towards the end, everyone was of the understanding that tasks just had to be done.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                The biggest struggle we had was communication as a whole group. While we used collaborative tools to our advantage, different schedules meant we were rarely able to meet as an entire group.  I believe that this is possibly unique to an online study environment as a team project in the workforce would typically enforce certain work hours and therefore there would be more consistent availability. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b><br>
                For me personally the most surprising thing was the motivation each member had to get on with their tasks to completion.  Having worked as a leader of a Team in a business environment for many years, I am used to projects stalling when newer team members wait for approval of ideas before moving forward.  With no corporate hierarchy all team members are equal which is refreshing! 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Have You Learnt About Groups:</b><br>
                My biggest learning from this exercise is how well a group can work when everyone’s motivation is the same.  No matter what age, what prior experience we had, we are all aiming for the same goal and bringing what skills we have to the table.  Without a company’s specific rules or policies (read red tape) to adhere to the team was able to get on with the job at hand however they saw fit.

            <p><b>What Went Well:</b>  <br>
                I think the meetings went well in what was discussed and having a team member writing down notes from the meeting was an essential part in being able to monitor progress and have a document to reflect on for planning. Microsoft One Note was great in allowing all team members to contribute and edit changes in real time if needed. Having a centralised place for all our work that was back up online was also a great safety measure.    
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                I think in an ideal world some members contribution could have been better, those who did not have major parts to play could of picked up pieces elsewhere. We could of started other sections earlier than we did but unfortunately had to wait on feedback and other means which slowed down those parts. Had we of had everything we needed from day one, and there wasn’t the miscommunication at the start we could of completed this much earlier than the due date. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b><br>
                How well everything flowed in getting the assignment completed. I don’t think there was really any issue along the way that we faced and I think having great communication and a couple of individuals who took charge was fundamental in this. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Have You Learnt About Groups:</b><br>
                That not everything is always going to go ahead according to plans and discussions. Whilst it is very handy noting things down and assigning tasks to individuals, real life can just take a swing and put a spanner in the works at any time.

            <p><b>What Went Well:</b> <br>
                I feel that roles were determined early with a consensus from the team, allowing us to work independently on items and flowing said items into a final project. Our meetings were very informative with members able to communicate effectively with each other and meeting minutes being taken and shared for each meeting. There was also continual communication through the use of Microsoft Teams and Discord IM’s, advising team members of changes and upcoming deadlines. Our team was able to communicate openly with members taking on feedback positively. Overall I am quite impressed with how well our team was able to work together.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                Personally, I feel that my contribution to the group was waning at times due to my commitments to work, however moving forward I do believe that coordinating my time more efficiently in the coming weeks will allow me to work more effectively with my team and contribute more. A couple of miscommunications occurred causing a few delays in the project completion, however this was only evident at the start of the project and seemed to improve as the team worked together.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b> <br>
                Our team was able to agree on a majority of the decisions made for the assignment, with the team collaborating to have tasks flow incredibly smoothly especially towards the middle-to-end of the project. The information and data we provided as a team looks to integrate nicely together, with sections often written by one team member and reviewed by another, providing a document that reads well

                <b>What Have You Learnt About Groups:</b><br>
                Collaborating effectively as a team can be difficult when done online, especially given different scheduling requirements. I learned how to work with a group of people from different backgrounds to aim towards a common goal. That being said, one of the keys to our successful collaboration is communication and visibility within the team.

            <p><b>What Went Well:</b> <br>
                The website and PDF file was done on time, the IT areas were written quite well in my opinion, and I believe that the other sections are also up to a high standard, there was communication with the team members and we were all active when it came to discussion in the team meetings. Scheduling future meetings while in a meeting was also great, people could discuss what time suited them best and we can change the meeting time if needed. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                I need to improve my communications skills, at the start, I was out of the loop because of an invitation link that didn't work, if I used the other channels of communication more effectively, I wouldn't have had that problem. Another I need to work on is pacing my work, I started off at a slow pace at the start but as the weeks went on, I ended up cramming more and more work into the same amount of time. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b> <br>
                I was amazed about the age range of the members in the group, there were a wide range in ages. Another thing that also surprised me was the location of my other group members, it turns out that we weren't all in Australia.

                <b>What Have You Learnt About Groups:</b><br>
                It can be difficult to make plans if the whole group isn't around for meetings, also, it is handy to have meeting minutes, that was something I didn't know about.

            <p><b>What Went Well:</b>   
                <br>
                Considering our group was only formed only days before being auto placed into a team, the team was really motivated and worked hard pretty much from the get the go. I was worried since the teachers had warned us to find a group as early on as possible and this not happening but was pleasantly surprised to find that I don’t think I could have belonged to a better group. 
                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                Even though I felt the group communicated rather well with tools we had, I felt with myself being in a different time zone and others having vastly different work schedules it was sometimes hard to organise a time we could all meet as often as I would have liked. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b><br>
                For myself, the most surprising part was that everyone was so motivated, even though our ages and careers are all largely contrasting everyone was keen to work hard and get their individual parts done. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Have You Learnt About Groups:</b><br>
                Having not done many team projects in recent times I did find it refreshing to have people to rely on. I was first worried I would have to do a lot of the grunt work myself but pretty much everyone pulled their weight which made the group assignment not nearly as difficult as I first thought.

                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                For myself I would improve my time management skills, as I didn’t finalise my IT area section as early as I could of, meaning I may not have contributed to other parts of the project as much as I could of.
                <br>
                For the team I would improve the task assigning as it took us quite a while to figure out who was doing which tasks and also what some of the tasks were 
                <br><br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b> <br>
                I was surprised by the group's ability to continually work and organise. The group didn’t seem to have any issues or conflicts and everyone was able to voice their own opinion on certain areas of the work.

        <div class="box">
            <h3>What Went Well:</h3>
            <p>Overall, our group worked very well together. Initially we were spread across different tools before agreeing on a single collaboration platform to work together on.  The use of Microsoft OneNote and Office365 worked extremely well, allowing us to sort and categorise each part of the assignment, and then work together editing others work where necessary.   We agreed on Roles early and each member was able to focus on their tasks, updating the team as they progressed. 
                <br>
                We held regular meetings, documented in meeting minutes which we referred to in each following meeting. This allowed us to ensure that we were focused and had regular status updates.  This also allowed members who may have been unable to attend every meeting a way to stay informed. </p>
            <h3>What Could Be Improved:</h3>
            <p>As a group we were able to identify one of our major weaknesses for this project, being a lack of communication particularly in the beginning phases. This could be due to time zone differences, current world events, or even prior work commitments. This lapse in communication early on resulted in some of the team feeling the assigning of tasks was delayed resulting in some members having trouble with deadlines.  
            <br>
            While the team did try to distribute the work evenly, there was some opportunity to share the tasks more evenly throughout the team. By improving communication methods and working towards more collaboration in the team, the above matters would be negligible. 
            </p>
            <h3>What Was Surprising:</h3>
            <p>Some of the things the we found surprising about our group was the diverse backgrounds and age ranges that we all come from, including locations around the world. Even this didn’t affect our ability to collaborate or cooperate.  The group's ability to click and work well from the first meeting were quite surprising adding in everybody's crazy work schedule, it was impressive to see everyone organise themselves around their work and come together to put maximum effort into this assignment. The motivation of everyone in the group over the entire assessment period was impressive and keeping up a tempo like that was surprising. </p>
            <h3>What Have You Learnt About Groups:</h3>
            <p>The biggest lesson learnt during this group exercise is that communication is key.  In an online environment where members have different commitments and even work in different time zones, communicating availability and progress is paramount.  As a group everyone has learned it is important to make sure work is evenly distributed and that work commitments are known to everyone as so other members can potentially take on a bit more work to keep the team ahead of its own timeline. </p>

            <p><b>Brackets</b><br>
                Brackets was the program used to make the website, this program was chosen because it was a simple and easy to use text editor that was specifically made for web development.

                <br>
                
                <b>Discord</b><br>
                Discord was used for communication at the start of the assignment, after some discussion, it was then agreed that all discussion will be moved to Microsoft Teams.
                <br>

                <b>GitHub</b><br>
                GitHub was used for the groups Git repository and to host the group website, GitHub is easy to use and the GitHub pages feature makes it easy to host a website.

                <b>Microsoft Teams</b><br>
                Microsoft Teams (Teams for short) was the main form of communication used for this assessment, Teams made it easy for group members to share files and the extra features, like the calendar, made it easy to plan meetings in advanced.

                <br>
                
                <b>Microsoft OneNote</b><br>
                Microsoft OneNote (OneNote for short) was the main program used for writing, OneNote made it easy for group members to collaborate on a piece of writing. The tab and page features in OneNote made it easy to organize the writing sections in our assessment.

                <br>
                
                <b>Microsoft Word</b><br>
                Microsoft Word (Word for short) was initially used for writing the report, after some discussion, it was agreed that the document would be written in LaTeX
                <br>
                <br>
                
                <b>TeXworks</b><br>
                TeXworks was used to write the document in LaTeX, it is a simple, multi-platform front-end program that makes writing in LaTeX easy.

                <br>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Git Audit Trail</h3>
            <p>Our Git audit trail is not an accurate representation of the amount of work each member contributed. Each of the text sections were written in OneNote, not in GitHub. Cameron uploaded the group website to GitHub, but William was the one that created it, the website was shared in the groups Teams chat before the Git repository was made. William was in charge of adding the information to the website and PDF document, he was not the one that wrote all the text. The large amount of deletions are due to merging web pages together.  
                <br>
                <br>
                As a group we feel that this represents a typical workflow of a team producing a report.  In this scenario GIT was used as a single version control system for the publishing of the document and Website, rather than a collaborative software development project, which GIT is more suited for.  After we reviewed and edited content in OneNote as a group, having one person in charge of the final publishing ensured consistency of the end product. </p>
