                <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <p>Hello, Shane Bunting (s3407441), team member of Creative Protocol. I am a 27 year old, Melbourne born Libra with my general interests being fitness, cars (Subaru all the way), computers, gaming, animation and security. Straight out of year 12 I went on to complete my certificate 4 in fitness and begin the journey into personal training. It was a weird time for PTs back then and from there I continued to upskill where possible and work on the side where ever I could. I obtained my pre app in electrical, but was unable to land a job due to being of mature age, basically it costed more to hire me.  I also attended university for Game Art and Animation, but financially living expenses where too much at the time so I had to leave and gain full time employment. Moving forwards, this lead me instead to many physical related jobs which brings us to now where I am in the hunt to pursue my hobbies and turn them into a career in something I am able to commit to long term, as my body has begun to give me signs that it's time to take it back a notch. When I was in year 10, about 15 years old, my parents took my brother and I out of school for a year and we travelled around Australia (Tasmania inc) and also the South island of New Zealand. It was a life changing experience that looking back on wasnâ€™t as bad as 15 year old me made it out to be.</p>
