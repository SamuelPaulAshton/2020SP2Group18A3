                <h3>Has the Burning Glass Industry data changed your mind?</h3>
                <p>Having worked in IT for nearly two decades, the review of the Burning Glass Job Title and skill data has not changed my idea of what my ideal job is.  If anything it has allowed me to reflect on the skills that I need to improve in order to be more successful in the industry as a whole.  I was already aware of the scarcity of demand for a CTO and that is part of the allure of it as an ideal job.  This said, a hands on role such as some form of Network Engineer does come with its own rewards and self satisfaction. In order to succeed in a CTO role I need to be able to encourage this form of success in others, motivating people to strive for their own self satisfaction.</p>

                <h3>Has the Burning Glass Industry data changed your mind?</h3>
                <p>Based on the Burning Glass industry data my thoughts on my original chosen ideal job of Senior Incident Response has not changed. Whilst not directly reflected or even listed within the data, it can be seen to closely resemble that of a Systems Administrator and a Network Security Manager. I was able to pick up some more information with respect to the 'best' or most sought after baseline and specialized skills that I can now add into my original 7 year plan. Currently not having much experience in the industry it is a big stretch to reach for such a high end position but I believe that this being my end goal, something I really want, that I am able to achieve it with hard work, determination and hopefully getting a mentor along the way.</p>

That being said, I have updated my ideal job from A1 to reflect a position that expands on more of the industry. I chose the position of a program manager as this role branches into varying IT technologies, providing organizational technology solutions from a high level perspective. I feel this role is more ideal for me as I work holistically and can learn more about the industry, perhaps finding a field to specialize in and a mentor for guidance in the process. </p>

                <h3>What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Samuel Ashton</b> - Chief Technical Officer</li>
                    <li><b>Shane Bunting</b> - Senior Incident Response</li>
                    <li><b>Jessica Delgado</b> - IT Program Manager</li>
                    <li><b>William Ericson</b> - Robotics Engineer</li>
                    <li><b>Matthew McCracken</b> - OT Network Security Administrator</li>
                    <li><b>Cameron McLaughlan</b> - Software Engineer</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Referring to the Burning Glass data, the only ideal job title that members of our team have chosen that are ranked is a Software Engineer, which is medium ranked in terms of demand.  We believe this is due to the fact that the majority of the ideal jobs we have chosen are reasonably senior roles, which are not in huge demand as there is typically less placements for them, or that the jobs chosen are industry specific.  This said the OT Network Security Administrator and Senior Incident Response roles may fit under Systems administrator or Network Engineer classifications. Both these roles are in more demand than Software Engineers, but not by a huge margin.    <br><br>    

                The CTO and Program Manager roles both involve the delivery of products or services, on one hand the CTO is tasked with ensuring that new technology is used in an effective manner to deliver new ideas or continually improve existing technology, whereas a Program Manager ensure the effective delivery of multiple projects across an organisation. The closest job title listed in the Burning Glass data that would align with these responsibilities would be a Service Delivery Manager, typically a Service Delivery Manager is more involved in day to day operations rather than new projects and research and development of new technology.  A Service Delivery Manager does not rank particularly high in demand, though again, this would be due to limited placements. <br><br> 

                A Robotics Engineer is slightly more difficult to categorize into the job titles listed by Burning Data. On one hand, software engineering would definitely be part of the role but some form of mechanical engineering position may be more appropriate, depending on which direction a Robotics Engineer focuses on.  Additionally, a Test Analyst role would also cover many of the roles and responsibilities required by a successful Robotics Engineer.  At this stage we feel that we are unable to accurately identify a demand ranking with the given Burning Glass Data <br><br></p>

                <h3>Ideal Job Comparisons</h3>
                
                <p>Three of the team members have selected managerial type jobs, two have selected engineering roles and one person has chosen an administrator job. At this stage no one has chosen to change their ideal job choice that was made by them. <br><br>

                    Even though these roles can be quite different, even within the same job title, depending from one company to another company eg. A Chief Technical Officer’s role for one company can be vastly different in another company although it carries the same title.<br><br>

                    Having reviewed the ideal jobs chosen by the group members and comparing them, it can be seen that although they are all different in some way there are some common skills required throughout all of them. Burning Glass has not ranked the specific ideal jobs chosen, but all of them require good communication skills, problem solving skills and organisational skills which are all top ranked skills according to the Burning Glass data.<br><br>

                    From the discussions held in the group it would appear that all the members have a plan in place to work towards their ideal jobs, which includes their plans to study towards getting the necessary qualifications as well as trying to get some experience in the field they have chosen to sharpen their specifically needed skills. <br><br></p>
                
                <h3>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
                
                <p>The supplied Burning Glass Data indicates that the highest in demand IT skill is SQL.  While this may not be directly required by the CTO and Program Manager roles, some understanding would be preferable.  The Software Engineer and Robotics Engineer roles would most definitely require SQL knowledge at some point as it is a staple method of interacting with data in a database.  Nearly all IT systems require or generate data at some point that will need to be stored, analysed or actioned. <br><br> 

                Not being able to predict the future trends of programming languages we have specified JavaScript as a key technical skill as it is a very popular language used for web applications and starting to become even more popular with application development using asynchronous on demand compilers such as Node.js. Being the second highest in demand IT skill it is highly beneficial to work towards understanding this technology as part of software engineering. <br><br> 

                Although often overlooked by non-management staff, ITIL is a core base for service delivery concepts.  We have listed this as a requirement for all of us to ensure that we have consistent support and development methodology.  ITIL does not rank particularly highly, funnily enough it sits alongside GIT, which in today's world, most IT staff should have an understanding.  We believe that these skills are not in high demand as it is assumed that most people have these as a base. <br><br></p>
                
                <h3>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
                
                <p>Several required general skills across our chosen ideal jobs are common, the biggest being Communication. Incidentally, according to the Burning Glass data this is the most required general skill of all, scoring more than twice the nearest ranking skill requirement, Problem Solving, which is also a common skill requirement. <br><br> 

                Demand for Decision Making and Multitasking are not ranked particularly highly but are also a very common skill across all of our chosen ideal jobs. In fact, Decision Making is the lowest ranked general skill, which we believe would be one of the most important in our ideal jobs.  What use is a Robotics Engineer, Software Engineer, Network Engineer or any other IT Management role without the ability to make a decision?  <br><br>   

                Slightly higher ranked than these is Management, Team Building, Leadership and Mentoring which are required for the CTO and Program Manager roles. <br><br></p>
                
                <h3>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set? </h3>
                
                <p>The highest three ranked IT Specific sills which are not in our required skill set are SAP, Graphic Design and Technical Support.  SAP is a fairly application specific requirement and not listed in our requirements as we are focused on the skills required by our chosen professions, rather than the knowledge of a particular operational tool that a prospective employer may use.  Many ERP solutions exist, SAP just happens to be one of the largest vendors.  Often businesses may even use their own proprietary ERP. <br><br> 

                None of our Ideal jobs require Graphic Design or Technical Support, in fact Idea jobs would involve having Graphic Designers and Technical Support Officers either reporting to us or working alongside us. <br><br></p>
                
                <h3>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set? </h3>
                
                <p>The three highest ranked general skills that we have not included in our required skill set are Writing, Detail-Oriented and Quality Assurance and Control.  In retrospect we will most likely find that this is a mistake, though these are lessons that typically have to be learnt on the job to truly understand.  Not many people within IT believe that they need good writing skills to succeed.  The unfortunate truth is that writing skills is much like communication.  In order to communicate your ideas accurately it is highly beneficial to be able to write them down.  Management roles involve reporting tasks that are better read when written well, and software development is a much smoother process when test cases can be accurately described in documentation. <br><br> 

                Detail Oriented and Quality Assurance and Control are also both skills that are requirements for any role in the IT industry.  Sure, it can be assumed that software testers are the main roles that require QA, but any engineer that does not QA their own work in some manner is a bad engineer.  Likewise attention to detail is often overlooked at being a core requirement for good Information Technology </p>
