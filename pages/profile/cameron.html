                <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <p>Hi, I'm Cameron McLaughlan (S3717363). Team: Creative protocol. I am currently 20 and working in the Australian army as a rifleman. I currently reside in Townsville but am originally from Melbourne. I completed year 12 in 2017 and have decided that I need to continue my learning and learn about something I am passionate in. My favourite activity to do in my spare time is canoe slalom, which a field of Whitewater kayaking My interest in IT started from a young age I had a relative who worked at apple and always had the newest computers and phones, from that young age I was hooked with all things technology. This love continued as I got into high school and was able to study multimedia in my earlier years than during my VCE study software engineering which is when I realised that I wanted to make some sort of career out of it.  My current career has lead me into signals and radios which has given me a different experience in networking and IP while also exposing me to how many different technologies and system work and connect to share data and information around the world securely and undetected.</p>
