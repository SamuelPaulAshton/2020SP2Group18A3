                <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Matt McCracken (s3864453). Team: Creative Protocol. I am a 35-year-old father of 2, who works full time for a hotel chain where I see to all their IT needs. I was born in Bundaberg, Queensland and, as a young boy, moved to Central West Queensland where I grew up. I currently live in Johannesburg, South Africa. I completed my school career at Barcaldine State School at the end of Grade 11, when I left to pursue a career in IT, as a trainee position opened up at the Department of Main Roads, this is also where I studied my Cert 2 in IT through Tafe. My personal interests are gaming, travel, golf, cricket, and rugby league. I have always had a keen interest in all things tech and like to keep up with what is happening in the world of Technology, both regarding hardware and software. I have always enjoyed understanding how things work, whether it was taking apart an old computer or looking at the source code of how a website was built. My experience in IT include 7 years at The Department of Main Roads following my initial traineeship in the IT department, 6 years as an IT Administrator for a Hotel chain.</p>
