        <p>For this project, a home-made flood and drain aquaponics system will be used as the 'test subject'. To properly describe the scope of the project, a brief background in Aquaponics is required. Diagram A show the basic concept of how this works.

          Fish are grown in a fish tank, with their waste turning into ammonia as a by-product.  Water is continually being pumped into the grow bed, which is typically above the fish tank, or at least higher. The grow bed is filled with a hydroponics medium such as clay balls, which acts as a biological filter for the fish tank. The ammonia in the water is converted to nitrites and then nitrates as in a typical fish tank filter, but rather than having to regularly change the water to remove the nitrates, the plants within the grow bed absorb them as part of their natural growth.  
          <br />
          <br />
          The bell siphon ensures that once the water level in the grow bed reaches a pre-determined top level, it siphons the entire grow beds water bac into the fish tank. This ensures that the plants roots are not continually submerged, preventing rot and damage. How often the grow bed is drained is controlled by the flow of water into the grow bed.

      <div class="box">
        With a limited time frame, the scope of what will be developed as part of this project needs to be defined in order to contain the work required.  Two milestones exist which coincide with the pitch videos.   
        <br>
        <br>
        The first milestone is at week six of the project. At this stage we will have a single client device measuring temperature and possibly water depth, logging these readings to a round robin database to have graphs generated regularly, and displayed on a single demonstration web site.  We will also have a a concept dashboard for the cloud based login created which will demonstrate the end goal. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This project will be completed at the end of sixteen weeks, which is the second and final milestone. We will have multiple client devices communicating their data to the cloud service, to be displayed using the dashboard design from the first milestone.  
        <br>
        <br>
        The use of certain technologies are considered outside the scope of the project and are assumed as existing knowledge.  This includes network connectivity, wireless or otherwise, and administration of IaaS platforms.
