            <h2>Interview Summary</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box">
            <p>
                As a team we have interviewed Cristian Atelj, manager of End User Services (EUS) for eHealth NSW. Cristian overlooks several teams that provide a variety of IT services for corporate and clinical environments in the health sector. While EUS supports mostly end user devices (Desktops, laptops, mobiles, etc) Cristian works closely with other support teams to ensure a unified service, including the likes of server/database support teams, and communications support teams just to name a few.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cristian expanded on his duties stating his role is more similar to a higher level management role than a technical role, supporting his staff of team leaders and their analysts/technicians. He describes his role as revolving around process and people, and dealing with being in the public sector which has it’s own challenges. Supporting health entities in the public sector means outages are often picked up by the media and is being discussed at a parliament level. 
                <br>
                <br>
                As the EUS manager role is somewhat high level, Cristian mentions dealing with a variety of different IT professionals, from level one support teams to external IT vendor companies. As his role involves supporting entities across the state level Cristian would need to communicate with stakeholders of different Local Health Districts (LHD) most commonly the CIO and service delivery manager of each LHD. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Recently, Cristian and his teams have been under pressure due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. While the IT industry as a whole was forced to adapt by implementing remote access services (RAS) for their staff, the health sector has been affected intensively as Cristian mentions. He continues to describe the challenges his teams have had when supporting a frontline service during a time of social distancing, describing it as a fine line to tread. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Moving from the private sector, Cristian has stated the biggest challenges he finds in his role is understanding the structure and public visibility. Health has a large list of policies and politics that come in to play. Cristian states, keeping up to date with the requirements of each entity and the policies surrounding them. Supporting multiple entities also provides a challenge for Cristian’s day-to-day, trying to provide a centralized service while also balancing the business requirements for said entity.

            <h2>Interview With An IT Professional</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Interview with Cristian Atelj</h3>
            <p><b>Creative Protocol:</b> Hi All, we have Cristian Atelj in the meeting here. Cristian, can you please tell us about your role 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Cristian:</b> Hi, I am currently the End User Services manager for eHealth and we support approximately eleven health agencies across NSW health, we have a team of 43 staff, so I have 4 team leaders under me and they have a cross mix of desktop analysts under each of these teams. So in terms of what we look after, hardware software, the SOE, we work with the engineering teams to develop those for the different entities and requirements, and we require 2nd and 3rd level support for approximately five to six thousand staff within those agencies. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CP:</b> That is quite a large scope 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CA:</b> Yea that is across NSW as well, NSW health is one of the largest employers of people in the southern hemisphere. eHealth have come on as a new entity, being established approximately 5 years ago. Each entity and LHD had its own support models and ICT components. eHealth was born out of a necessity to centralise that model, into something manageable that can set standards and offer services to the smaller agencies as some of the entities aren't as larger as the other LHD's however still require support. It wasn't cost-effective to have multiple teams across 10 different entities. Which is where that centralisation was born. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CP:</b> Similar to an IT service provider would provide IT support to smaller businesses in the private sector 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CA:</b> Exactly, you would probably call us similar to a managed service provider, eHealth have a bunch of different services they offer in the ICT field from a service desk model, you have desktop teams and then End User Services (EUS), then moving to server environments and database support teams. We also have project managers and strategy/architect teams. We cover a large cross section of ICT 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CP:</b> And what kind of work would you say you do in your day-to-day 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CA:</b> It is quite an involving role as a group manager, leading the team leaders, and setting the expectation of the business to filter down is a big portion of the day. Managing staff at a certain level, moving away from some technical aspects, and be more of a people manager, more of it revolves around people and processes, and some politics. In health and the public sector, there are some politics in the process, as it can be in the private sector, whereas the public sector is more reporting to the public of Australia and NSW. Instead of shareholders, you have the public to respond to, in the health sector you are front-page news [if something goes wrong]. If there are issues in terms of a hospital network go down or the eMR (Electrical Medical Record) system going down, or the hospital losing support for 2 hours it is front-page news and you are reporting to Parliament, it is different than a private company 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CP:</b> You mentioned that you deal with a lot of the team leaders in other teams, what other IT professionals do you interact with in your Day to Day 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CA:</b> Sure, The end-user services team sits within customer service in eHealth and that customer service remit is part of that service delivery department, within that we have a demand delivery team. My direct peers entail a demand delivery team, which is more program management and project coordination. Then we have service management, which entails the service delivery managers, continual services improvement team. We also have, that sit under their remit is the operational vendor management team. We also have the change management team and the onboarding team, and the State-Wide Service Desk (level one helpdesk). As my direct colleagues, I deal with these different teams weekly to touch base and we have a fortnightly basis with the director to see how the team is progressing, what the pain points are. Trying to celebrate success. At that level, you have to portray that message across to senior management to ensure you are being well represented and the team is doing well. If you aren't advocating for your team it is difficult for someone else to do so. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CP:</b> You would also deal with the likes of vendors and such? 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CA:</b> Correct, as a remit as well and by design, we have service offerings that we so call sponsor. Being an end-user computer support provider we deal with the likes of HP, Microsoft, and Toshiba for our managed print solutions. We need to maintain those relationships and ensure they are contract friendly and held accountable. Monthly or quarterly meetings with each vendor, and having that operational vendor manager keeping in touch with them as well. I am sure they keep to the contract and standards they signed up for. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CP:</b> Thank you, and where would you say you spend most of your time? 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CA:</b> It's definitely difficult, I think one of the challenges is how you spend your time. At a certain level, you get invited to a lot of meetings, and you need to allocate some of your time doing rather than participating in [Technical activities], so you need to be selective in that aspect. A lot of my time at the moment is onboarding a new solution, we have a couple of inflight projects that are highly visible that we need to deliver upon. COVID and other situations that impact NSW health quite intensively, making these projects highly visible at a senior management level and there is some effort in that area at the moment and the last 2 to 3 months that is where most of my time has been spent 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CP:</b> Very challenging during the COVID times 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CA:</b> Yea, it is a challenging space, especially with staff working from home you need to find a happy medium, especially being a frontline service. It is hard to fix a hardware issue over the phone, so we need to manage the expectation of the customer and manage our staff and their wellbeing, it is definitely a fine line we tread. Definitely some challenging times we have experienced over the past 2 to 3 months 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CP:</b> From the look of it and other companies it seems to be paying off. The last question of the day, what would you say is the most challenging part of your role? 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>CA:</b> I spent a majority of my career in the private sector, so I recently moved into the public sector and I wasn't really prepared for the challenges that I would deal with, such as the unions and the was the structure is within the org and the public sector, I would say this is one of the biggest components and challenges, understanding that component, I had to overcome rather quickly. And understanding the policies in place within health, I've had to invest some time in that. It is very challenging keeping up to date with that and understanding that, which is a challenge when moving into the public sector. The other challenging one at the moment, I have stepped into the public sector and moved into this role approximately 8 months ago, I moved across from Ambulance which was supporting a single entity and was contained. Moving across to this role expanded my portfolio to multiple entities, each of those are unique, how we transition them and how we support them into a consolidated model, you kind of have to think outside of the box. You need to utilize expertise from colleagues I have had in the past, utilizing their experience. But I would say these are the two most challenging items on my list at the moment </p>
