            <p><b>What Went Well:</b> <br>
                Because we put in a lot of effort in assignment 2, it was easier to do this assignment compared to the previous one. A lot of the groundwork was already done 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                It was tough working around peoples schedules, in the final two weeks, it was harder to discuss everything as a complete group. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b> <br>
                Even though it was tough for everyone's schedule to line up, we managed to get a lot of work done.

                I learnt to be flexible, not everyone is available when you are and vice versa.

            <p><b>What Went Well:</b>   
               Having done very well on assignment 2 I feel our group was a lot more ease at the process of the group assignment. I feel there were a lot less unnecessary meetings, most were more comfortable and understood how each member of the group worked.

                <br>
                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                Even though I feel the process of the assignment 3/5 was a lot easier then assignment 2 it was still difficult with my time zone being so vastly different to everyone else’s.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b><br>
                Having seen everyone’s commitment for assignment 2 I was not surprised by all the effort put into assignment 3, it was still great to see everyone working so hard on this assignment.

                <b>What Have You Learnt About Groups:</b><br>
                Having now completed assignment 2/3/5 as a group I feel a lot easier working with others and having others to rely on in crunch times. That has made look forward to more group tasks in the future.
