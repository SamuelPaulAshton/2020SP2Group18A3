                I  believe that we went far beyond what was actually required for Assignment 2, so we already had most of the groundwork for Assignment 3 done.  Majority of this assignment was just clarifying details and putting things down to an actual 'project plan'

                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                <br>
                Whether it could be improved or not but during this assignment we found that our different circumstances meant that it was almost impossible to meet as a group in entirety.

                <br>
                No matter the difference in circumstances, each team member did everything they  could to contribute. Some members had work commitments take them out of communication range, while others were just too busy with work. Even with these hurdles everyone contributed to their best abilit

                <br>
                The biggest thing I have learnt about groups during this assignment is to be accepting of others circumstances. Studying remotely is a unique scenario where everyone is at a different stage of life and has different prior commitments

                The flow from assignment 2 into assignment 3 was rather easy having completed more than required previously. The other team members stepped up as they did in the last one and tackled a huge portion of the work load.

                Reading the finer details of the assignment itself to pick up little bits and pieces that were missed originally.

                <br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b><br>
                Just how little there was to add on but also just how much there was to add on from assignment 2. There were a lot of things that stayed the same but took a different angle/approach this time around.

                That life will always get in the way no matter how much you plan and try and organise. In saying that with the different time zones certain members had, continued work hours and even adventures away things managed to get done as there were people who stepped up and took control of the situations.

            <p><b>What Went Well:</b> <br>
                Because we put in a lot of effort in assignment 2, it was easier to do this assignment compared to the previous one. A lot of the groundwork was already done 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                It was tough working around peoples schedules, in the final two weeks, it was harder to discuss everything as a complete group.

                <br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b> <br>
                Even though it was tough for everyone's schedule to line up, we managed to get a lot of work done.

                I learnt to be flexible, not everyone is available when you are and vice versa.

            <p><b>What Went Well:</b>   
               Having done very well on assignment 2 I feel our group was a lot more at ease with the process of the group assignment. I feel there were a lot less unnecessary meetings, most were more comfortable and understood how each member of the group worked. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                Even though I feel the process of the assignment 3/5 was a lot easier then assignment 2 it was still difficult with my time zone being so vastly different to everyone else’s.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b><br>
                Having seen everyone’s commitment for assignment 2 I was not surprised by all the effort put into assignment 3, it was still great to see everyone working so hard on this assignment.

                <b>What Have You Learnt About Groups:</b><br>
                Having now completed assignment 2/3/5 as a group I feel a lot easier working with others and having others to rely on in crunch times. That has made look forward to more group tasks in the future.
