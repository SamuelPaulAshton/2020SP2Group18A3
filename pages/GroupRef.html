                I  believe that we went far beyond what was actually required for Assignment 2, so we already had most of the groundwork for Assignment 3 done.  Majority of this assignment was just clarifying details and putting things down to an actual 'project plan'

                Whether it could be improved or not but during this assignment we found that our different circumstances meant that it was almost impossible to meet as a group in entirety.

                <b>What Was Surprising:</b><br>

                
                No matter the difference in circumstances, each team member did everything they  could to contribute. Some members had work commitments take them out of communication range, while others were just too busy with work. Even with these hurdles everyone contributed to their best abilit

                The biggest thing I have learnt about groups during this assignment is to be accepting of others circumstances. Studying remotely is a unique scenario where everyone is at a different stage of life and has different prior commitments

                The flow from assignment 2 into assignment 3 was rather easy having completed more than required previously. The other team members stepped up as they did in the last one and tackled a huge portion of the work load.

                <b>What Was Surprising:</b><br>
                Just how little there was to add on but also just how much there was to add on from assignment 2. There were a lot of things that stayed the same but took a different angle/approach this time around.

                That life will always get in the way no matter how much you plan and try and organise. In saying that with the different time zones certain members had, continued work hours and even adventures away things managed to get done as there were people who stepped up and took control of the situations.

            <p><b>What Went Well:</b> <br>
                From working with the team on the previous assignment, our previous strengths on communication of set roles early allowed for us to work independently on items and flowing said items into a final project. All communication in our meetings was clear and documented well with meeting minutes being taken and shared for each meeting. There was also continual communication through the use of Microsoft Teams and Discord IM’s, advising team members of changes and upcoming deadlines. Our team was able to communicate openly with members taking on feedback positively. I am quite positive with how my team has been able to work together

                <br>
                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                While we had most of the project already defined from the previous assignment, there was often times of doubt with what needed to be done next. We were able to affectively sort out the next steps and coordinate it as a team. A few last minute changes from the team could be better communicated earlier.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b> <br>
                The most surprising part of working with this team is how we were able to agree on most aspects of the project, the team was able to communicate all feedback productively and all feedback was taken on with considerable thought. Any issues that arose was quickly dealt with which was assisting our team in time management.

                <b>What Have You Learnt About Groups:</b><br>
                Real life events will often get in the way of teams being able to communicate or meet up regularly. Often times I have known groups of people to not take real life events into consideration, however this team has been very open and understanding especially considering the current world events and other unforeseen circumstances

            <p><b>What Went Well:</b> <br>
                Because we put in a lot of effort in assignment 2, it was easier to do this assignment compared to the previous one. A lot of the groundwork was already done

                <br>
                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                It was tough working around peoples schedules, in the final two weeks, it was harder to discuss everything as a complete group.

                <br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b> <br>
                Even though it was tough for everyone's schedule to line up, we managed to get a lot of work done.

               Having done very well on assignment 2 I feel our group was a lot more at ease with the process of the group assignment. I feel there were a lot less unnecessary meetings, most were more comfortable and understood how each member of the group worked.

                <br>
                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                Even though I feel the process of the assignment 3/5 was a lot easier then assignment 2 it was still difficult with my time zone being so vastly different to everyone else’s.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b><br>
                Having seen everyone’s commitment for assignment 2 I was not surprised by all the effort put into assignment 3, it was still great to see everyone working so hard on this assignment.

                Having now completed assignment 2/3/5 as a group I feel a lot easier working with others and having others to rely on in crunch times. That has made look forward to more group tasks in the future.

            <p><b>What Went Well:</b>  <br>
                The website and PDF file was done on time, the IT areas were written quite well in my opinion, and I believe that the other sections are also up to a high standard, there was communication with the team members and we were all active when it came to discussion in the team meetings. Scheduling future meetings while in a meeting was also great, people could discuss what time suited them best and we can change the meeting time if needed.
                <br><br>
                <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
                For myself I would improve my time management skills, as I didn’t finalise my IT area section as early as I could of, meaning I may not have contributed to other parts of the project as much as I could of.
                <br><br>
                <b>What Was Surprising:</b> <br>
                I was surprised by the group's ability to continually work and organise. The group didn’t seem to have any issues or conflicts and everyone was able to voice their own opinion on certain areas of the work.

                <b>What Have You Learnt About Groups:</b><br>
                One thing I have learnt about groups is that it is important to be flexible and understanding of everyone in the group.

            <h3>What Went Well:</h3>
            <p>Having worked well together on assignment 2 working through assignment 3/5 has been a lot smoother of an experience. We have communicated well over Microsoft Teams while using OneNote for the basis of our assignments. Meetings have been kept to a minimum with everyone knowing what is expected of them, so everyone is able to focus of their tasks and updating OneNote as they progress. With two group assignments due at the same time there was concern this could split up the group and spread our resources too thin, but the group has managed the workload well and managed to complete both assignments on time. </p>
            <h3>What Could Be Improved:</h3>
            <p>Having done so well on assignment 2 and with how smoothly assignment 3/5 have gone there hasn't been much space for improvement. That being said having everyone in a similar time zone and with similar work schedules would make attendance at group meetings easier. As these issues that are beyond anyone's control they cannot really be improved upon. </p>
            <h3>What Was Surprising:</h3>
            <p>As a group we were able to identify one of our major weaknesses for this project, being a lack of communication particularly in the beginning phases. This could be due to time zone differences, current world events, or even prior work commitments. This lapse in communication early on resulted in some of the team feeling the assigning of tasks was delayed resulting in some members having trouble with deadlines.  
While the team did try to distribute the work evenly, there was some opportunity to share the tasks more evenly throughout the team. By improving communication methods and working towards more collaboration in the team, the above matters would be negligible.  </p>
            <h3>What Have You Learnt About Groups:</h3>
            <p>Coming to the end of the last of the assignments it was clear to all of us that communicating between one and other and being open about what is happening around the clock really helped get everyone through the assignments as it had done in previous times. The biggest lesson we learnt as a group is that life can and always will get in the way and i think groups has taught us that with appropriate planning  and regular catch ups, that meeting deadlines, be it assignments or not, anything is possible. </p>
