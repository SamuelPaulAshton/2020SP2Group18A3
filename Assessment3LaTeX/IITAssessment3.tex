I am a 27 year old, Melbourne born Libra with my general interests being fitness, cars (Subaru all the way), computers, gaming, animation and security. Straight out of year 12 I went on to complete my certificate 4 in fitness and begin the journey into personal training. It was a weird time for PTs back then and from there I continued to upskill where possible and work on the side where ever I could. I obtained my pre app in electrical, but was unable to land a job due to being of mature age, basically it cost more to hire me.  I also attended university for Game Art and Animation, but financially living expenses where too much at the time, so I had to leave and gain full time employment. Moving forwards, this instead led me to many physical related jobs. This brings us to where I am now, I am on the hunt to pursue my hobbies and turn them into a career in something I am able to commit to long term, as my body has begun to give me signs that it's time to take it back a notch. When I was in year 10, about 15 years old, my parents took my brother and I out of school for a year and we travelled around Australia (Tasmania inc) and also the South island of New Zealand. It was a life changing experience that looking back on wasn’t as bad as 15 year old me made it out to be.

For my hobbies, while I enjoy listening to music, I also used to make my own, I studied Music Performance and Technical Production, Yes, I have performed live, no, I will not show you the videos. Over the years, I have hoarded a fair bit of music, while the bulk of my collection is digital (it takes up less space), I also have a sizeable collection of CDs and cassette tapes (and a few records here and there). I've been interested in IT from a young age, it all started when one of my cousins showed me how to use Cheat Engine, while I had fun adding extra stuff to the games I played, I also enjoyed putting in random codes and seeing what it would do. Before joining RMIT, I studied Computing at Deakin College and then Computer Science at Deakin University, but it reached the point where rent was too expensive, so I had to leave.

I am currently 20 years old and working in the Australian army as a rifleman. I currently reside in Townsville but am originally from Melbourne. I completed year 12 in 2017 and have decided that I need to continue my learning and learn about something I am passionate about. My favourite activity to do in my spare time is canoe slalom, which is a field of white-water kayaking. My interest in IT started from a young age I had a relative who worked at apple and always had the newest computers and phones, from that young age I was hooked with all things technology. This love continued as I got into high school and was able to study multimedia in my earlier years, then during my VCE, study software engineering, which is when I realised that I wanted to make some sort of career out of it.  My current career has lead me into signals and radios which has given me a different experience in networking and IP while also exposing me to how many different technologies and systems work and connect together to share data and information around the world securely and undetected.

\section{Group Processess}

\subsection{How did your group work together in Assignment 2? Will you be introducing any changes in process for Assignment 3?}
Based on the group reflection from Assignment 2, although there was a bit of a rocky start, as the group was spread across different tools, once a single collaboration platform was agreed upon things became a lot more smooth. It was found communication was best over Microsoft Teams while collaborating our work using Microsoft OneNote and Office365 worked well for the team and allowed us to work well to complete what needed to be done on the assignment. 

Everybody’s roles in the team was agreed on early, so each member was able to focus on their tasks and keep the team updated on their progress. Regular meetings were also held and minutes were made in the meetings which could be referred back to in subsequent meetings, which allowed group members to stay focused and updated. The minutes also allowed members who may have missed the meeting to stay informed.  

In the beginning phases of the assignment, there was some lack in communication, this was due to various reasons, including location and work commitments. Once communication methods were improved the team worked well together to meet the deadlines.  

We learned that in an online environment, where members have different commitments and schedules, it is of upmost importance that they communicate effectively. It is also vital that each member knows their role and what is expected from them so that deadlines are met or exceeded. 

We thus feel that we have found a formula which works well for our team and we will continue to use this formula going forward in our assignments. 

\section{Career Plans}
\subsection{Compare and contrast the career plans, including ideal jobs, for each person in the group. What common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others, if anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the group?}
For each of the ideal jobs chosen by the group, a good foundation is a Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology as well as obtaining entry level experience in their chosen fields. Although all the ideal jobs start with a Bachelor’s Degree, each one would branch out into their own specific field and specialize in the skills they require for their ideal job. It is also often recommended that an internship be done in the chosen field, this allows for some hands on training as well as being a good opportunity to network which could lead to job offers and also give you good contacts in the IT industry. Another similarity, throughout the IT industry is that anyone in this industry are often expected to keep on top of the latest digital trends, and they should also know how said trends will impact their particular field.
